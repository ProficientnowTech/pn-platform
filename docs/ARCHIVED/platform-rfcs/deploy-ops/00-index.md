# A GitOps-Native, Argo-First Platform Deployment Orchestration Architecture

---

## Status of This Memo

This document specifies a standards-track architecture for deterministic platform
deployment orchestration within Kubernetes-based infrastructure. Distribution of
this memo is unlimited within the organization and to authorized external reviewers.

This document is a DRAFT and is subject to change based on review feedback.

## Abstract

This Request for Comments (RFC) defines a comprehensive, GitOps-native,
Argo-first architecture for platform deployment orchestration in Kubernetes
environments. The architecture addresses the fundamental challenges of deploying
complex, interdependent platform stacks consisting of 40+ applications with
intricate dependency relationships.

The system establishes a phase-driven model where deployment progresses through
well-defined stages: bootstrap, orchestration, steady-state, and teardown. Each
phase has explicit authority boundaries and deterministic transition criteria.
The architecture eliminates human-in-the-loop operations for nominal deployments
through DAG-based dependency resolution using Argo Workflows, replacing
error-prone bash scripts and race-condition-susceptible PreSync hooks.

The system treats deployment ordering as a first-class concern with defined
dependency graphs, health propagation contracts, and explicit failure semantics.
A containerized executor provides a unified interface for deploy, validate, and
teardown actions, guaranteeing idempotency across all operations.
