# Appendix A: Glossary and Indexes

[← Previous: Future Considerations](./09-evolution.md) | [Index](./00-index.md#table-of-contents) | [Next: References →](./appendix-b-references.md)

---

This appendix applies to **Sections 1 through 9** of this RFC.

It introduces **no new behavior**. Its purpose is **reference, traceability,
and longevity**.

---

## A.1 Glossary of Terms

This glossary defines terms **as used in this RFC**, not in general industry
usage.

---

### Core Concepts

---

#### Application (ArgoCD)

A Kubernetes custom resource that defines a set of Kubernetes resources to be
deployed from a Git repository source. ArgoCD Applications are the primary
unit of deployment management.

---

#### Bootstrap

The initial setup phase (Day 0-1) where orchestration primitives are installed
on a bare Kubernetes cluster. Bootstrap transforms a cluster into one capable
of self-managing through GitOps.

---

#### DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)

A graph structure where edges have direction and no cycles exist. In this RFC,
DAGs represent dependency relationships between deployment nodes.

---

#### Dependency

A relationship where one component requires another to be operational before
it can function. Dependencies are explicitly declared and enforced during
deployment.

---

#### Executor

The containerized component providing a unified interface for platform
lifecycle operations (deploy, validate, teardown). The executor is stateless
and idempotent.

---

#### GitOps Handoff

The point in the deployment lifecycle where authority transitions from
imperative bootstrap to declarative GitOps management. Marked by creation
of the Root Application.

---

#### Health Status

The operational state of a resource. Standard statuses include Healthy,
Progressing, Degraded, Suspended, and Missing.

---

#### Idempotency

The property where an operation produces the same result regardless of how
many times it is executed with the same inputs.

---

#### Invariant

A rule that MUST always hold true. Violating an invariant invalidates the
architecture.

---

#### Layer

A conceptual grouping of components with related responsibilities and
authority. The four layers are: Bootstrap, Orchestration, Deployment,
Promotion.

---

#### Orchestration

The coordination of multiple deployments in correct dependency order with
health verification. Orchestration determines *when* things deploy, not
*what* deploys.

---

#### Phase

A stage in the deployment lifecycle with defined pre-conditions, actions,
and transition criteria. The five phases are: Pre-Bootstrap, Bootstrap,
Orchestration, Steady-State, Teardown.

---

#### Stack

A logical grouping of related Applications that deploy together. Examples:
infrastructure stack, security stack, monitoring stack.

---

#### Sync Wave

An integer annotation on Kubernetes resources that determines ordering
**within a single ArgoCD Application**. Sync waves do not order across
Applications.

---

#### Target Chart

A Helm chart that generates ArgoCD Application resources. Used in the
App-of-Apps pattern to create Applications from templates.

---

### Status Terms

---

#### Healthy

A resource that is fully operational, serving traffic (if applicable), and
passing all health checks.

---

#### Progressing

A resource that is transitioning toward desired state. Not yet healthy but
making progress.

---

#### Degraded

A resource that is partially operational. Some functionality may be impaired.

---

#### Suspended

A resource that is intentionally paused. Not an error state.

---

#### Missing

An expected resource that does not exist in the cluster.

---

#### Synced

An ArgoCD Application where the live state matches the desired state from Git.

---

#### OutOfSync

An ArgoCD Application where the live state differs from the desired state.

---

### Phase Terms

---

#### Day 0

Infrastructure provisioning. Creating the Kubernetes cluster itself.

---

#### Day 1

Initial application deployment. Installing platform components on the cluster.

---

#### Day 2+

Ongoing operations. Maintenance, updates, and continuous operation of the
platform.

---

### Technical Terms

---

#### ClusterWorkflowTemplate

An Argo Workflows resource defining a reusable workflow template available
cluster-wide.

---

#### EventBus

An Argo Events resource providing message transport between EventSources
and Sensors.

---

#### EventSource

An Argo Events resource that produces events from external sources (webhooks,
schedules, Kubernetes events).

---

#### Freight (Kargo)

A versioned bundle of artifacts (Git commits, container images) that can be
promoted through Stages.

---

#### Health Propagation

The mechanism by which health status flows from child resources to parent
resources, enabling aggregate health assessment.

---

#### PreSync Hook

An ArgoCD resource annotation causing a Job to run before Application sync.
This RFC prohibits using PreSync hooks for dependency orchestration.

---

#### Six-Phase Task Structure

The mandatory structure for Ansible bootstrap tasks: pre-check, apply, test,
validate, rollback, result. Each phase has defined responsibilities ensuring
tasks are reproducible, deterministic, and revertable.

---

#### Sensor

An Argo Events resource that evaluates events and triggers workflows when
conditions match.

---

#### Stage (Kargo)

A Kargo resource representing an environment (dev, staging, prod) through
which Freight is promoted.

---

#### Warehouse (Kargo)

A Kargo resource that monitors sources (Git, images) and creates Freight
when changes are detected.

---

## A.2 Architecture Decision Record (ADR) Index

This index summarizes **key architectural decisions**, their rationale, and
where they are defined.

---

### ADR-001 — DAG-Based Orchestration Over Hooks

- **Decision**: Use Argo Workflows DAGs for cross-application orchestration
- **Rationale**: Hooks have race conditions; DAGs provide deterministic ordering
- **Defined In**: [Section 2](./02-requirements.md), [Section 8](./08-rationale.md)

---

### ADR-002 — Layered Authority Model

- **Decision**: Separate bootstrap, orchestration, deployment, and promotion layers
- **Rationale**: Clear boundaries prevent authority conflicts
- **Defined In**: [Section 3](./03-architecture.md)

---

### ADR-009 — Deployment-Time Only Dependency Enforcement

- **Decision**: Dependencies are enforced at deployment time, not runtime
- **Rationale**: Cascading deletions are dangerous; applications should be resilient
- **Defined In**: [Section 3.7](./03-architecture.md#37-runtime-dependency-failure-semantics)

---

### ADR-010 — Helm-Only Installation Method

- **Decision**: All bootstrap installations MUST use Helm charts exclusively
- **Rationale**: Consistent templating, upgrade/rollback capability, release tracking
- **Defined In**: [Section 6.2.1](./06-lifecycle-management.md#621-ansible-bootstrap-standards)

---

### ADR-011 — Six-Phase Task Structure

- **Decision**: Every Ansible task MUST implement pre-check, apply, test, validate, rollback, result phases
- **Rationale**: Ensures reproducibility, determinism, and recoverability
- **Defined In**: [Section 6.2.1](./06-lifecycle-management.md#621-ansible-bootstrap-standards)

---

### ADR-012 — Single Production Environment Scope

- **Decision**: This RFC addresses single-cluster, production-only deployment
- **Rationale**: Multi-environment platform promotion is deferred to future evolution
- **Defined In**: [Section 3.9](./03-architecture.md#39-environment-scope)

---

### ADR-003 — Ansible-Recommended Bootstrap

- **Decision**: Recommend Ansible for bootstrap, remain technology-agnostic
- **Rationale**: Idempotent, declarative, Kubernetes-native modules
- **Defined In**: [Section 4](./04-components.md)

---

### ADR-004 — Containerized Executor

- **Decision**: Package deployment interface as container image
- **Rationale**: Portable, reproducible, air-gap capable
- **Defined In**: [Section 7](./07-executor-specification.md)

---

### ADR-005 — Health-Gated Progression

- **Decision**: Require explicit health verification before proceeding
- **Rationale**: Sync completion alone does not indicate operational readiness
- **Defined In**: [Section 2](./02-requirements.md), [Section 5](./05-orchestration-mechanics.md)

---

### ADR-006 — PreSync Hook Prohibition

- **Decision**: Prohibit PreSync/PostSync hooks for dependency logic
- **Rationale**: Race conditions make hooks unreliable for this purpose
- **Defined In**: [Section 2](./02-requirements.md), [Section 8](./08-rationale.md)

---

### ADR-007 — Single-Cluster Initial Scope

- **Decision**: Focus on single-cluster deployment; defer multi-cluster
- **Rationale**: Solve core problem first; multi-cluster is additive
- **Defined In**: [Section 2](./02-requirements.md), [Section 9](./09-evolution.md)

---

### ADR-008 — Argo Ecosystem Adoption

- **Decision**: Use Argo Workflows, ArgoCD, Argo Events, Kargo together
- **Rationale**: Consistent patterns, tight integration, proven at scale
- **Defined In**: [Section 3](./03-architecture.md), [Section 4](./04-components.md)
