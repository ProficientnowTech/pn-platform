## 1.1 Background and Context

Secret management is deceptively simple at small scale and brutally
unforgiving at larger scale.

In early stages of a platform, secrets are often handled through a
combination of:

- environment variables,
- CI/CD-injected credentials,
- manually created Kubernetes Secrets,
- and ad-hoc automation scripts.

This approach is common, pragmatic, and initially effective.

The platform described in this RFC followed exactly this trajectory.

It is important to state clearly:

> **The architecture proposed in this RFC was *not* designed or implemented
> from the beginning.** It emerged as a necessity, driven by accumulated
> operational pain, recurring failures, and scaling constraints.

This RFC exists because the original system reached a point where:

- incremental fixes no longer worked,
- operational risk increased faster than delivery velocity,
- and secret management became a persistent source of incidents and human error.

---

## 1.2 The Initial System (Pre-Architecture State)

The original secret management approach evolved organically alongside the
platform.

At a high level, it consisted of:

- Secrets sourced from multiple places:
  - local `.env` files,
  - CI/CD environment variables,
  - manually generated credentials in external dashboards,
  - manually created Kubernetes Secrets.

- A growing collection of **bash scripts** responsible for:
  - reading environment variables,
  - generating random values,
  - templating Kubernetes manifests,
  - encrypting or sealing secrets,
  - applying resources to the cluster.

- Partial GitOps adoption:
  - application manifests were Git-managed,
  - secrets were only partially declarative.

Rotation, bootstrap, and recovery were handled through **procedural
execution**, not through a system with explicit guarantees.

This system worked — until it didn't.

---

## 1.3 Operational Shortcomings

As the platform grew, several structural problems became apparent.

### 1.3.1 Secrets Were Not First-Class Entities

Secrets existed implicitly inside:

- scripts,
- CI/CD configuration,
- human memory,
- and external SaaS dashboards.

There was no single authoritative answer to:

- *What secrets exist?*
- *Who owns them?*
- *Which services depend on them?*
- *Which ones expire and when?*

The absence of a clear inventory made auditing, reasoning, and troubleshooting
increasingly difficult.

---

### 1.3.2 Manual Rotation Became a Persistent Risk

Many secrets had finite lifetimes:

- API tokens,
- cloud provider credentials,
- SMTP passwords,
- identity provider secrets.

Rotation followed a fragile manual loop:

1. Remember that a secret was expiring.
2. Locate the correct dashboard or service.
3. Generate a new credential.
4. Update environment variables or local files.
5. Re-run scripts.
6. Re-apply manifests.
7. Restart workloads and hope the change propagated correctly.

This process:

- did not scale,
- relied heavily on human discipline,
- and regularly failed silently.

Production issues caused by expired or partially rotated secrets became routine.

---

## 1.4 The Cost of Script-Driven Secret Management

Bash scripts became the backbone of the system.

Over time, they accumulated responsibilities well beyond their original intent:

- validation logic,
- secret generation,
- conditional execution,
- encryption and sealing,
- orchestration and ordering.

This introduced systemic problems:

- **Implicit state**
  Script behavior depended on local files, cached outputs, and environment
  variables that were not versioned or observable.

- **Non-reproducibility**
  Running the same script on two machines could yield different results.

- **Opaque failure modes**
  Partial failures were common and difficult to diagnose.

- **Human coupling**
  Correct operation depended on tribal knowledge rather than enforced guarantees.

The scripts did not merely automate work — they became an undocumented
control plane.

---

## 1.5 Why Incremental Fixes Failed

Multiple attempts were made to improve the system incrementally:

- better scripts,
- stricter operational runbooks,
- stronger encryption mechanisms,
- additional validation steps.

These efforts reduced symptoms but never addressed the root problem.

The underlying issue was architectural:

> **Secrets were treated as deployment artifacts instead of lifecycle-managed
> system resources.**

As long as secrets remained procedural, scattered, and human-driven,
complexity and risk continued to grow.

---

## 1.6 Why a Dedicated Secrets Platform Became Necessary

At scale, secret management requires:

- explicit authority boundaries,
- automated lifecycle handling,
- deterministic bootstrap,
- safe and observable rotation,
- strong auditability,
- and reproducibility from source control.

These requirements CANNOT be satisfied by:

- scripts,
- ad-hoc conventions,
- or partial GitOps adoption.

The system described in subsequent sections represents a **structural
correction**, not an optimization.

It formalizes secret management as:

- a platform subsystem,
- with clearly defined phases,
- controlled handovers,
- and strict separation between bootstrap, runtime, and rotation responsibilities.

Only with such a system can the platform:

- eliminate entire classes of human error,
- scale across clusters and environments,
- and remain operationally sustainable.
