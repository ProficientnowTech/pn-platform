# 2. Requirements and Invariants

[← Previous: Introduction](./01-introduction.md) | [Index](./00-index.md#table-of-contents) | [Next: Architecture →](./03-architecture.md)

---

This section defines the **constraints and invariants** that shape all
subsequent architectural and implementation decisions. No design presented
in later sections MAY violate the principles established here.

---

## 2.1 Core Problem Restatement

The platform REQUIRES a secrets management system that:

- scales with organizational and infrastructure growth,
- eliminates human-driven operational workflows,
- enforces correctness through system guarantees rather than conventions,
- remains reproducible and auditable over time,
- and operates independently of any single operator, workstation, or external SaaS UI.

The system MUST work under the assumption that:

- clusters MAY be destroyed and rebuilt,
- teams and operators will change,
- and failures will occur.

The architecture MUST therefore be **resilient by construction**, not by discipline.

---

## 2.2 Design Goals

### 2.2.1 Secrets as First-Class Platform Resources

Secrets MUST be treated as:

- explicit entities,
- with defined ownership,
- lifecycle stages,
- and documented relationships to consuming systems.

A secret's existence, scope, and purpose MUST be **observable and auditable**,
not implicit.

---

### 2.2.2 Git as the Source of Intent, Not Runtime State

Git MUST define:

- *which* secrets exist,
- *why* they exist,
- *where* they are consumed,
- and *how* they are initially introduced.

Git MUST NOT define:

- the current runtime value of rotating secrets,
- short-lived credentials,
- or secrets whose lifecycle is managed dynamically.

This distinction is foundational.

---

### 2.2.3 Vault as the Runtime Authority

All non-bootstrap secrets MUST ultimately be owned by a runtime secrets system.

That system MUST:

- enforce access control,
- track metadata and expiry,
- support rotation,
- and act as the single runtime source of truth.

Kubernetes MUST NOT be the system of record for secrets.

---

### 2.2.4 Zero Human-In-The-Loop for Steady-State Operations

After initial bootstrap, the system MUST operate without requiring humans to:

- remember rotation schedules,
- re-run scripts,
- apply secrets manually,
- or restart workloads explicitly.

Human involvement is permitted only for:

- initial trust establishment,
- policy changes,
- and exceptional recovery scenarios.

---

### 2.2.5 Deterministic Bootstrap

Given:

- a Git repository,
- a cryptographic root of trust,
- and a Kubernetes cluster,

the system MUST be able to reach a fully operational state **deterministically**.

Bootstrap MUST NOT depend on:

- undocumented steps,
- local machine state,
- or operator-specific knowledge.

---

### 2.2.6 Cloud and Provider Agnosticism

The architecture MUST:

- function on-premises,
- avoid hard dependencies on cloud-managed services,
- and remain portable across environments.

Cloud integrations MAY exist but MUST NOT be required for correctness.

---

### 2.2.7 High Availability by Design

Wherever feasible, the system SHOULD:

- avoid single points of failure,
- degrade gracefully,
- and recover automatically.

Where HA is not immediately possible, the design MUST allow it without
re-architecture.

---

## 2.3 Non-Goals

The following are explicitly **out of scope** for this architecture:

### 2.3.1 Application-Level Secret Reload Logic

How applications reload secrets (hot reload vs restart) is an application concern.

The platform guarantees secret propagation, not application behavior.

---

### 2.3.2 CI/CD as a Control Plane

CI/CD systems MAY exist, but:

- they MUST NOT be required for cluster correctness,
- they MUST NOT be the source of truth for secrets,
- and they MUST NOT hold exclusive authority over secret state.

The platform MUST remain operational without CI/CD.

---

### 2.3.3 Human-Friendly Secret Editing Interfaces

This architecture prioritizes correctness and automation over interactive UX.

Any UI is a convenience layer, not a dependency.

---

### 2.3.4 Cross-System IAM Design

User identity, RBAC, and organizational IAM models are intentionally excluded.

This system focuses solely on **machine-consumed secrets**.

---

## 2.4 Architectural Invariants

The following rules are **non-negotiable invariants**.
Violating any of these invalidates the design.

---

### Invariant 1 — Git MUST Be Sufficient for Reconstruction

Given Git and the platform itself, a cluster MUST be rebuildable.

No external UI state, dashboards, or undocumented secrets MAY be required.

---

### Invariant 2 — Bootstrap Secrets Are Temporary Scaffolding

Secrets required before the runtime system exists:

- MUST be explicitly classified as bootstrap secrets,
- MUST be encrypted at rest in Git,
- and MUST NOT be reused by applications.

They MUST be retired once runtime authority is established.

---

### Invariant 3 — Rotation MUST NOT Require Git Changes

Rotating a secret MUST NOT require:

- committing to Git,
- re-encrypting files,
- or reapplying manifests manually.

Rotation is a runtime concern.

---

### Invariant 4 — Authority Transfers MUST Be Explicit

Any transition of ownership (e.g., bootstrap → runtime) MUST be:

- intentional,
- observable,
- and auditable.

Implicit or accidental duplication of authority is forbidden.

---

### Invariant 5 — Kubernetes Is a Consumer, Not an Authority

Kubernetes Secrets exist only to satisfy application consumption requirements.

They are derived artifacts, not sources of truth.

---

### Invariant 6 — No Hidden Control Planes

Any system capable of mutating secret state is a control plane.

All such systems MUST be:

- visible,
- documented,
- and intentionally introduced.

Scripts, workstations, and dashboards MUST NOT silently function as control planes.

---

### Invariant 7 — Internal Secrets MUST Traverse Vault *(v1.1)*

Secrets generated by in-cluster operators that require cross-namespace
distribution:

- MUST be pushed to Vault via PushSecret,
- MUST be pulled from Vault via ExternalSecret,
- and MUST NOT be directly copied between namespaces.

This ensures:

- audit trail for all cross-namespace secret access,
- rotation coordination through a single authority,
- and policy enforcement at the Vault layer.

Direct namespace-to-namespace secret copying violates the single-authority
principle and creates hidden data flows.

See [Section 5a](./05a-internal-distribution.md) for the complete framework.

---

### Invariant 8 — Configuration Data MAY Use Secret Distribution *(v1.1)*

Non-sensitive configuration data (endpoints, ports, connection parameters)
that requires cross-namespace distribution:

- MAY use the same PushSecret/ExternalSecret pattern,
- MUST use separate Vault paths from secrets (`platform-config/` vs `platform-data/`),
- and MUST NOT be treated as a security boundary.

Configuration distribution is a **convenience mechanism** for centralized
discovery and management, not a security control.

See [Section 5a.5](./05a-internal-distribution.md#5a5-vault-path-conventions)
for path conventions.

---

## 2.5 Operational Philosophy

The system is designed around the following operational beliefs:

- **Automation is not optional** — it is a correctness requirement.
- **Human memory is not a dependency**.
- **Failures will happen**; recovery MUST be routine.
- **Security comes from structure**, not secrecy.
- **Convenience is achieved by removing repetition**, not by adding shortcuts.

This philosophy informs every tradeoff made later in the design.

---

## 2.6 Success Criteria

This architecture is considered successful if:

- Secrets rotate without human intervention.
- Clusters can be rebuilt without manual secret recreation.
- Auditors can trace secret provenance and lifecycle.
- Platform engineers are not required to remember operational rituals.
- The system remains understandable years after its creation.
