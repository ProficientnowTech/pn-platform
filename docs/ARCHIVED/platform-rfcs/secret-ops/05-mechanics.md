# 5. Operational Mechanics

[← Previous: Components](./04-components.md) | [Index](./00-index.md#table-of-contents) | [Next: Rotation →](./06-rotation.md)

---

This is the **first section that is prescriptive**. Anything defined here is
considered **normative behavior** for the system.

---

## 5.1 Terminology and Resource Types

To avoid ambiguity, the following terms are used consistently.

### Secret Classifications

- **Bootstrap Secret**
  A secret required to initialize the runtime system. Exists *before* runtime
  authority.

- **Runtime Secret**
  A secret owned and lifecycle-managed by the runtime authority.

- **Derived Secret**
  A secret produced by infrastructure or controllers and pushed into runtime
  authority.

---

### Core Resource Types

| Resource               | Purpose                                          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Encrypted Manifest     | Stores bootstrap secrets encrypted in Git        |
| Bootstrap Secret       | Temporary Kubernetes Secret                      |
| Runtime Secret         | Secret stored in runtime authority               |
| Materialized Secret    | Kubernetes Secret derived from runtime authority |
| Orchestration Workflow | Declarative multi-step automation                |
| Event Trigger          | Time- or signal-based workflow trigger           |
| PushSecret *(v1.1)*    | Syncs K8s Secret to runtime authority            |
| Internal Secret *(v1.1)* | Operator-generated secret for distribution     |
| Internal Configuration *(v1.1)* | Service endpoint data for distribution   |

---

## 5.2 Bootstrap Mechanics (Pre-Vault)

### Initial Conditions

At time zero:

- Git repository exists
- Encrypted secret manifests exist
- Kubernetes cluster is empty
- No runtime authority exists

---

### Bootstrap Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Git as Encrypted Git
    participant Argo as GitOps Controller
    participant K8s as Kubernetes API

    Git->>Argo: Sync encrypted bootstrap manifests
    Argo->>Argo: Decrypt manifests
    Argo->>K8s: Create Bootstrap Secrets
```

---

### Key Properties

- Bootstrap secrets:
  - MUST be decrypted only inside the cluster
  - MUST NOT be written back to Git
  - MUST be scoped to minimal namespaces

- Decryption keys MUST NOT be stored in Git
- Bootstrap secrets MUST be explicitly labeled and traceable

---

### Security Invariant

> Bootstrap secrets MAY exist **only until runtime authority is established**.

---

## 5.3 Runtime Authority Initialization

The runtime secret authority is deployed **using bootstrap secrets only for
its own initialization**.

### Responsibilities

- Initialize storage backend
- Generate master keys
- Produce unseal material
- Establish internal access policies

The runtime authority becomes **self-sufficient** once initialized.

---

### Initialization Sequence

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Argo as GitOps Controller
    participant K8s as Kubernetes
    participant Vault as Runtime Authority

    Argo->>K8s: Deploy runtime authority
    Vault->>Vault: Initialize & seal
    Vault->>K8s: Store sealed unseal material
    Vault->>Vault: Enter standby until unsealed
```

---

### Invariant

Once initialized, the runtime authority:

- MUST NOT depend on bootstrap secrets
- MUST persist state independently of Git

---

## 5.4 Explicit Authority Handover

Authority handover is the **most critical operation** in the system.

It MUST be:

- explicit
- auditable
- idempotent

---

### Handover Workflow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Boot as Bootstrap Secret
    participant Orch as Orchestrator
    participant Vault as Runtime Authority

    Orch->>Boot: Read bootstrap secret
    Orch->>Vault: Write runtime secret
    Vault-->>Orch: Acknowledge write
    Orch->>Boot: Mark consumed
```

---

### Handover Rules

- Bootstrap secret is **copied**, never moved
- Runtime authority becomes authoritative immediately
- Bootstrap secret is:
  - deleted, or
  - rendered inert, or
  - ignored by all consumers

This operation happens **once per secret**.

---

## 5.5 Steady-State Secret Lifecycle

After handover, all secret lifecycle operations occur **exclusively** in the
runtime authority.

---

### Read Path

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Vault as Runtime Authority
    participant ESO as Materialization Layer
    participant K8s as Kubernetes
    participant App as Workload

    Vault->>ESO: Secret value
    ESO->>K8s: Materialized Secret
    K8s->>App: Mount / Inject
```

---

### Write Path

- No writes originate from Git
- No writes originate from Kubernetes
- All writes originate from:
  - orchestrated workflows
  - runtime secret engines
  - PushSecret synchronization from operator-generated secrets *(v1.1)*

---

### Internal Distribution *(v1.1)*

For secrets generated within the cluster by operators or controllers that require
cross-namespace distribution, the steady-state lifecycle includes an additional
publication phase. These **internal secrets** traverse Vault via the PushSecret
mechanism before being consumed via ExternalSecret.

See [Section 5a](./05a-internal-distribution.md) for the complete internal
distribution framework, including decision criteria, path conventions, and
component responsibilities.

---

## 5.6 Rotation and Expiry Handling

Rotation is **NOT a Git operation**.

### Rotation Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Event as Timer/Event
    participant Orch as Orchestrator
    participant Vault as Runtime Authority
    participant ESO as Materialization

    Event->>Orch: Trigger rotation
    Orch->>Vault: Generate new secret
    Vault->>Vault: Revoke old secret
    Vault->>ESO: Updated secret
    ESO->>K8s: Update materialized secret
```

---

### Rotation Guarantees

- Rotation MUST be idempotent
- Rotation MUST be auditable
- Rotation MUST NOT require cluster redeploy
- Consumers MUST receive updates automatically

---

## 5.7 Failure Modes and Recovery

### Bootstrap Failure

- No runtime authority created
- Safe to retry
- No partial state

---

### Handover Failure

- Runtime authority remains unchanged
- Bootstrap secret remains authoritative
- Workflow retries safely

---

### Runtime Authority Failure

- No rotation
- Existing secrets remain valid
- Recovery resumes lifecycle automatically

---

### Cluster Loss

- Re-run bootstrap
- Re-establish runtime authority
- Restore secrets from runtime storage backend

---

## 5.8 Security and Trust Guarantees

This design guarantees:

- **Single authority at any time**
- **No secret sprawl**
- **No hidden mutation paths**
- **Minimal blast radius**
- **Auditable lifecycle**

---

## 5.9 Summary

This operational mechanics section:

- makes bootstrap explicit,
- removes ambiguity from authority transitions,
- and enables full automation without scripts.

It completes the mechanical foundation of the system.
