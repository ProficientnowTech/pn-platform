# 8. Design Rationale

[← Previous: Security](./07-security.md) | [Index](./00-index.md#table-of-contents) | [Next: Evolution →](./09-evolution.md)

---

This section documents **explicit architectural decisions** and the
**rationale for rejecting alternatives**.

---

## 8.1 Why This Section Exists

Architectures rarely fail because they were wrong at inception.
They fail because **future changes violate original assumptions**.

This section exists to:

- make trade-offs explicit,
- record historical context,
- prevent architectural regression,
- and explain *why* certain seemingly simpler approaches were rejected.

All alternatives discussed here were **seriously considered**.

---

## 8.2 Sealed Secrets–First Architectures

### Description

Secrets are encrypted using a cluster-specific public key and committed to
Git as Kubernetes Secret objects.

At runtime:

- a controller decrypts them,
- Kubernetes becomes the primary secret store.

---

### Why It Was Attractive

- Simple mental model
- Kubernetes-native
- No external dependency
- Easy early adoption

---

### Why It Was Rejected

1. **Cluster-Coupled Encryption**
   - Secrets are bound to a single cluster
   - Disaster recovery requires resealing
   - Multi-cluster reuse is fragile

2. **Kubernetes Becomes the Authority**
   - Violates the invariant that Kubernetes MUST be a consumer
   - No native rotation or TTL handling

3. **Rotation Requires Git Changes**
   - Forces runtime operations into Git
   - Breaks automation guarantees

---

### Conclusion

Sealed Secrets is suitable for **small or static systems**.
It does not meet the lifecycle, rotation, or scalability requirements of this
platform.

---

## 8.3 argocd-vault-plugin–Centric Designs

### Description

Secrets are pulled directly from a runtime authority and injected into
manifests during GitOps render time.

---

### Why It Was Attractive

- No secrets in Git
- Direct Vault integration
- Minimal moving parts

---

### Why It Was Rejected

1. **Render-Time Only**
   - Secrets are resolved once
   - No native runtime refresh

2. **ArgoCD Becomes a Privileged Secret Broker**
   - Enlarges blast radius
   - Violates separation of duties

3. **Rotation Is Indirect and Implicit**
   - Requires resyncs
   - Hard to audit

---

### Conclusion

This approach works for **simple workloads**, but does not support:

- robust rotation,
- explicit authority boundaries,
- or long-lived operational safety.

---

## 8.4 CI/CD–Driven Secret Injection

### Description

CI pipelines fetch secrets from external stores and inject them into the
cluster during deployment.

---

### Why It Was Attractive

- Familiar workflow
- Easy integration with SaaS providers
- Minimal cluster-side complexity

---

### Why It Was Rejected

1. **CI Becomes a Hidden Control Plane**
2. **Cluster Is Not Rebuildable from Git**
3. **Auditability Is Split Across Systems**
4. **Operational Correctness Depends on Pipeline Health**

---

### Conclusion

CI/CD is a delivery mechanism, **NOT a source of truth**.
Using it as one violates GitOps principles.

---

## 8.5 GitHub Environments as Source of Truth

### Description

Secrets are stored in GitHub Environments and synchronized into the cluster.

---

### Why It Was Attractive

- Managed secret storage
- Good UX
- Easy rotation

---

### Why It Was Rejected

1. **External System Dependency**
2. **State Lives Outside Git**
3. **Platform Is Not Self-Contained**
4. **Disaster Recovery Requires Manual Reconciliation**

---

### Conclusion

This approach optimizes convenience at the cost of **reproducibility and
independence**.

---

## 8.6 "Just Use Vault" (No GitOps Bootstrap)

### Description

Vault is manually initialized and populated.
GitOps assumes Vault always exists.

---

### Why It Was Attractive

- Clean runtime model
- No bootstrap secrets

---

### Why It Was Rejected

1. **Bootstrap Paradox Ignored**
2. **Human Dependency at Initialization**
3. **No Deterministic Recovery**

---

### Conclusion

Vault is a **runtime authority**, not a bootstrap solution.

---

## 8.7 Kubernetes Secrets as the Authority

### Description

Secrets are created and managed directly in Kubernetes.

---

### Why It Was Attractive

- Native API
- Simple consumption

---

### Why It Was Rejected

1. **No Rotation Semantics**
2. **Weak Access Control Model**
3. **Poor Auditability**
4. **Secrets Become Deployment Artifacts**

---

### Conclusion

Kubernetes Secrets are **delivery mechanisms**, not lifecycle managers.

---

## 8.8 Bash-Driven Orchestration

### Description

Scripts coordinate secret generation, encryption, and deployment.

---

### Why It Was Attractive

- Fast to implement
- Flexible
- No new infrastructure

---

### Why It Was Rejected

1. **Implicit State**
2. **Non-Reproducibility**
3. **Opaque Failures**
4. **Human-Coupled Execution**

---

### Conclusion

Scripts do not scale as control planes.
They inevitably become undocumented infrastructure.

---

## 8.9 Why Incremental Improvements Were Insufficient

Each rejected approach failed for the same reason:

> **They attempted to fix symptoms without correcting authority and lifecycle
> boundaries.**

The chosen architecture succeeds because it:

- models bootstrap explicitly,
- assigns single authority at every phase,
- and treats rotation as a system responsibility.

---

## 8.10 Why Vault as Intermediary for Cross-Namespace Distribution *(v1.1)*

### Description

When operators or controllers generate secrets within the cluster that require
distribution to consumers in other namespaces, there are several approaches to
accomplish this.

---

### Rejected Alternatives

#### Direct Copy / Mirror Controllers

Controllers like reflector or kubed that directly copy Secrets between namespaces.

**Why It Was Rejected**

1. **No Audit Trail**
   - Secret copies happen without centralized logging
   - Cannot trace who accessed what or when

2. **Ambiguous Authority**
   - Multiple copies of the same secret exist
   - Source vs. copy distinction becomes unclear over time

3. **Rotation Coordination Complexity**
   - When source rotates, copies must be synchronized
   - No guarantee of atomic propagation

---

#### External Secrets with Kubernetes Backend

Using ESO's Kubernetes provider to pull Secrets from other namespaces.

**Why It Was Rejected**

1. **Violates Invariant 5**
   - Kubernetes becomes the authority (the referenced Secret)
   - Contradicts "Kubernetes Is a Consumer, Not an Authority"

2. **No Centralized Policy**
   - Access control relies on RBAC for cross-namespace Secret reads
   - No unified enforcement point

---

#### Manual Namespace-Scoped Secrets

Creating identical Secrets manually in each consumer namespace.

**Why It Was Rejected**

1. **Doesn't Scale**
2. **Rotation Requires Multiple Updates**
3. **Configuration Drift Risk**

---

### Why Vault Intermediary Was Chosen

The PushSecret → Vault → ExternalSecret pattern was selected because it:

1. **Maintains Single Authority**
   - Vault is the authoritative distribution point
   - Source Secret and materialized Secrets are clearly distinguished

2. **Provides Audit Trail**
   - All reads and writes logged through Vault
   - Centralized access visibility

3. **Enables Versioning**
   - KV v2 engine provides version history
   - Rollback capability exists

4. **Centralizes Policy**
   - Vault policies enforce access at a single point
   - Policy changes apply uniformly

5. **Supports Automatic Rotation Propagation**
   - Operator rotates source → PushSecret syncs → ExternalSecrets update
   - No manual coordination required

---

### Conclusion

Using Vault as an intermediary for internal secret distribution maintains the
architectural invariants while enabling scalable cross-namespace distribution.
The additional complexity is justified by the audit, policy, and lifecycle
benefits.

See [Section 5a](./05a-internal-distribution.md) for the complete framework.

---

## 8.11 Summary

The final architecture is not the simplest possible solution.
It is the **simplest solution that satisfies all invariants simultaneously**.

Every rejected alternative violated at least one invariant defined in
[Section 2](./02-requirements.md).
