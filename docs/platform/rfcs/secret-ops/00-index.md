# A GitOps-Native, Vault-First Secret Management Architecture

---

## Status of This Memo

This document specifies a standards-track architecture for secret management
within the platform infrastructure. Distribution of this memo is unlimited
within the organization and to authorized external reviewers.

This document is a DRAFT and is subject to change based on review feedback.

## Abstract

This Request for Comments (RFC) defines a comprehensive, GitOps-native,
Vault-first architecture for secret management in Kubernetes-based platforms.
The architecture addresses the fundamental challenges of secret lifecycle
management, including bootstrap, authority transitions, rotation, and
recovery. This specification establishes a phase-driven model where secrets
progress through well-defined stages with explicit authority boundaries,
eliminating human-in-the-loop operations for steady-state secret handling.

The system treats secrets as first-class platform resources with defined
ownership, lifecycle stages, and documented relationships to consuming
systems. Git serves as the source of intent (not runtime values), while a
dedicated runtime secret authority manages the actual secret lifecycle
including rotation, expiry, and access control.
