---

### Normative Consumers

**[RFC-IAM-0001]** "Federated Identity and Access Management Architecture"
`docs/platform/rfcs/iam/00-index.md`

RFC-IAM-0001 defers to RFC-SECOPS-0001 for all secrets management concerns including:
- Keycloak client secret storage and distribution
- ExternalSecret patterns for identity-bound secrets
- Vault as the authoritative secret store

---

### Planned Consumers

**[RFC-PAM-0001]** (Planned) "Privileged Access Management Architecture"
`docs/platform/rfcs/pam/PLAN.md`

RFC-PAM-0001 will consume RFC-SECOPS-0001 for:
- **Vault SSH Secrets Engine**: Certificate authority for SSH authentication
- **Vault Database Secrets Engine**: Dynamic, ephemeral database credentials
- **ESO Distribution**: Teleport agent enrollment secrets

**[RFC-WORKLOAD-IDENTITY-0001]** Platform Engineering, "Workload Identity Architecture", RFC-WORKLOAD-IDENTITY-0001, February 2026.
`docs/platform/rfcs/workload-identity/00-index.md`

RFC-WORKLOAD-IDENTITY-0001 consumes RFC-SECOPS-0001 for:
- Vault Kubernetes authentication (§5)
- Dynamic database credentials for services (§5.3)
- ESO secret distribution patterns (§4.6)
- Service-to-service credential management
